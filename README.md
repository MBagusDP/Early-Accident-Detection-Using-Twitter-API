# Early-Accident-Detection-Using-Twitter-API

In today’s society, people are always using their computer devices, especially smartphone. Through many applications inside the phone, we can easily find any information that we desired. Nowadays, news that are updated through Social Media applications can be obtained faster than the information that are searched manually through the internet browser, or news that are presented through a Television, given the option that many Social Media applications are allowing the users to spread their own opinion freely. An application goes by the name Twitter allowing us to gain information faster than any Social Media available today. This platform is used to share their thoughts about many kind of things that are happening in their lives, or share the latest news with the aim to make it go viral or a trending news where everyone can see. Unlike any other Social Media, Twitter have this features where you can repost a tweet called retweet. the more retweet that our tweet gets, the faster our tweet will spread.

My objective in this project is to gain information about an accident as fast as possible through Twitter. With the help of Twitter API, we can gain access through the tweeted texts of many different accounts. Through text processing, we will be able to create a Machine Learning model which can help us identify which text is about an accident and which text are not by going through keywords from each tweeted texts. However, with the limited amount of time given to create this project, I surf through Kaggle.com to find the dataset that I needed.

In this application, you will find:
  1. Requesting data trough Twitter API
  2. Processing text data in Bahasa using Natural Language Processing
  3. Prediction using Naive Bayes Machine Learning Model
